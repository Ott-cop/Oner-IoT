This project aims to create a robust and efficient Internet of Things (IoT) system using the ESP32 microcontroller, MQTT protocol (Mosquitto), and the Rust programming language ü¶Ä. The system allows seamless communication between IoT devices through MQTT, enabling real-time data exchange and remote monitoring.


## Key Features:

- <b>ESP32 Integration:</b> Leverages the power of the ESP32 to enable wireless communication and IoT functionality, supporting both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections.
  
- <b>MQTT Protocol:</b> Utilizes the lightweight and efficient MQTT protocol for reliable message delivery between devices, allowing for low-latency communication in IoT applications.
  
- <b>Rust for Safety and Performance:</b> Written in Rust, the project benefits from memory safety and high performance, making it ideal for constrained devices with limited resources.
  
- <b>Scalability:</b> Designed to support multiple IoT devices communicating with each other via a central MQTT broker, allowing easy scalability as more devices are added to the network.
  
- <b>Real-time Data:</b> Implements real-time data collection, processing, and visualization, with low power consumption and high reliability.

## Application Use Cases:

- Home automation (e.g., smart lighting, temperature monitoring);
- Environmental monitoring (e.g., air quality, weather stations);
- Industrial IoT (e.g., equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance);

With the combination of ESP32, MQTT, and Rust, this project provides a powerful and flexible platform for building secure, scalable, and real-time IoT applications.
